# Robotron 2000 ðŸ‘¾

Welcome to Robotron 2000! This is a simple web page that allows you to build your own robot using various components. Let your creativity run wild and assemble the ultimate robot with the desired stats.

## ðŸ¤– What Does This Code Do?

This code represents the user interface of the Robotron 2000 application. It is an HTML file that includes CSS styles and JavaScript functionality. Here's a breakdown of its structure and functionality:

- The HTML file provides the structure of the page, including sections for displaying the robot, its statistics, and the component builder.
- The CSS file (`style.css`) is linked to the HTML file and defines the visual styles for the elements.
- The JavaScript file (`main.js`) handles the dynamic behavior of the form and updates the robot's statistics based on the selected components.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Customize the robot's appearance by selecting a color using the buttons in the "Escolha uma cor" section.
4. Adjust the quantities of the robot's components (arms, armor, cores, legs, rockets) using the +/- buttons.
5. Once you're satisfied with the configuration, click the "Iniciar produÃ§Ã£o" (Start Production) button.
6. Watch your robot come to life and see its statistics update accordingly.
