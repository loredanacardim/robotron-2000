# Robotron 2000 ðŸ‘¾

Welcome to Robotron 2000! This is a simple HTML web page that allows you to build your own robot using various components. Let your creativity run wild and assemble the ultimate robot with the desired stats.

## ðŸ¤– What Does This Code Do?

This code represents the user interface of the Robotron 2000 application. Here's a breakdown of its structure and functionality:

### HTML Structure

The HTML structure consists of several sections:

- The "robotron" section displays the Robotron 2000 logo.
- The "estatisticas" section shows the robot's statistics, such as strength, power, energy, and speed.
- The "equipamentos" section contains a form for building the robot.
  - Within the form, there are different components to assemble:
    - "BraÃ§os" (Arms)
    - "Blindagem" (Armor)
    - "NÃºcleos" (Cores)
    - "Pernas" (Legs)
    - "Foguetes" (Rockets)
- The "producao" input allows you to submit the form and start the robot production.

### Styling and Fonts

The code includes external CSS stylesheets to enhance the visual presentation. It uses the Teko font from Google Fonts to give a futuristic touch to the interface.

### JavaScript Interaction

The code also includes a JavaScript file, `main.js`, which is responsible for handling the dynamic behavior of the form and updating the robot's statistics based on the selected components.
